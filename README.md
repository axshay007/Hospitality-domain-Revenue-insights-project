# Hotel-Revenue-Dashboard---Power-BI-Project-For-Hospitality-Domain
# Problem Statement:
**Problem Statement**: To assist Rajvansh Hotels and Palaces in optimizing revenue, we aim to derive actionable insights and leverage statistical measurements in the domain of hotel management.

**Solution Approach**:
**Solution Approach**: To achieve revenue growth for Rajvansh Hotels and Palaces, we will employ statistical measures to analyze their business data. We will focus on tracking weekly and monthly trends, conduct Level 1 and Level 2 analyses, and design an effective Power BI dashboard while adhering to the principle of asking "three whys" to uncover deeper insights.

# Solution Details:
**Statistical Measures**: Utilize statistical measures such as PEVPAR (Revenue per Room Available) and ADR (Average Daily Rate) to assess the hotel's financial performance.

**Tracking Weekly and Monthly Trends**: Monitor the hotel's revenue and occupancy data on both weekly and monthly scales to identify patterns and anomalies.

**Level 1 and Level 2 Analysis**:
- **Level 1 Analysis**: Conduct a preliminary analysis to understand the overall revenue and occupancy trends, identify seasonal patterns, and pinpoint any obvious revenue drivers.

- **Level 2 Analysis**: Delve deeper into the data by segmenting it further. Analyze revenue and occupancy patterns for different room types, customer segments, and booking sources. This analysis will provide a more granular view of what factors are driving revenue.

**Power BI Dashboard Design**:
- **Dashboard Characteristics**: The Power BI dashboard will embody the following characteristics:
  - **Clarity**
  - **Interactivity** 
  - **Relevance**:
  - **Consistency** 
  - **Usability**
  - **Actionability**

**The "Three Whys" Approach**:
- Embrace the "Three Whys" principle in data analytics, which involves asking a series of "why" questions to uncover root causes and underlying factors behind observed trends or issues.
- By repeatedly asking "why," we aim to move beyond surface-level insights and identify actionable strategies for revenue growth.

By executing this comprehensive approach, Rajvansh Hotels and Palaces will have access to data-driven insights, enabling them to make informed decisions and drive revenue growth in their hotel management operations.

     - Data Modeling and Schema: Explain how data is structured, including Fact Tables (e.g., sales transactions) and Dimension Tables (e.g., time, rooms, guests). Justify the importance of data modeling for efficient analytics.

## 2. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):
   - Introduce DAX as a formula language used in Power BI for creating calculated columns and measures.
   - Two Concepts in DAX:
     - Calculated Columns: Define these as columns calculated based on expressions and existing data.
     - Measures: Explain that measures are calculations used for aggregations, often involving SUM, AVERAGE, or other functions.
   - Discuss the importance of understanding DAX for creating custom calculations in hotel revenue analysis.
   - Mention specific DAX calculations related to weekdays, weekends, no-shows, and cancellations.

## 3. Dashboarding:
   - Explain the process of creating interactive dashboards in Power BI.
   - Showcase how data, calculated metrics, and visualizations come together to provide insights.
   - Emphasize the role of effective data visualization in conveying information to stakeholders and decision-makers.
